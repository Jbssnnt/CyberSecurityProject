# CyberSecurityProject
2018 Curtin Cybersecurity Project

tracer.py - A file that uses strace to track the system calls being made. Currently only tested on an Ubuntu subsystem running on windows. 
            Must be run as sudo in order to track all processes.
fileIO.py - A file with some reusable file input and output functions that may be useful for the project. Currently only writes to a csv file and reads a file of PIDs to be traced.
